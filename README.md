This directory contains a program for building loop coordinates out
of Phi and Psi torsion angle data generated by the OML searchdb program.

NOTE - this input is akin to the format generated by `pdbtorsions`
with the `-o` flag set. i.e. the omega angle is associated with the
residue before rather than the residue after.

Ideally, the program requires the torsions file generated by SearchDB
to contain omega angles as well; this is the only way you will get
decent results which look like the original structure. Currently
SearchDB does not provide this information so, using the -o flag, you
can ask genloop to create loops with omega=180.0 and read the current
output from SearchDB
